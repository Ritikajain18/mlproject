# IEEE JMI ML Project Series

This is the repository for the Machine Learning Research Group organized by IEEE JMI for the students who want to get 
into ML with a solid grasp on the core concepts. 

We are inviting you to apply to work with us on a 2-month long series of projects which will take you through practical machine learning faster and easier than any online tutorial. We want to make this a tightly knit group of students working together with guidance from their seniors. You will work on at least 10 different non-trivial projects through the course of this series and all these will lead to one real-world research based project at the end.

## Interested to Join? 
**[Apply HERE](https://forms.gle/TcUD5iUmGieJUUzx5)**

We will not take up the usual pre-prepared example projects that are used in tutorials, but will rather encourage you to come up with your own daily life problems to solve. You will be given intermittent classes on topics that are important for you to learn. We will explain those things that need to be explained via these classes, videos, reading material etc.

What this series is NOT
1. This is NOT just a tutorial series. You will be expected to work and produce results.
2. This is NOT just a video lecture course. You will work hands-on with projects.
3. This is NOT just a Whatsapp group or mailing list. Although we will stay connected with you.

Expected Date of Commencement: 10th July 2020
Expected Date of Completion: 10th September 2020
